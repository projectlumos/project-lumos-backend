Web Development,"Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications (or just 'web apps') electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. Most recently Web development has come to mean the creation of content management systems or CMS. These CMS can be made from scratch, proprietary or open source.

Data Science,"Data science, also known as data-driven science, is an interdisciplinary field of scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured, similar to data mining.",https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/Data-Science-vs.-Big-Data-vs.jpg
Machine Learning,"Machine learning is a field of statistics and computer science that gives computer systems the ability to ""learn"" (i.e. progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed.",https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/modern-future-technology/128/artificial-intelligence-512.png
App Development,"Mobile app development is a term used to denote the act or process by which a mobile app is developed for mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones. These applications can be pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms, or delivered as web applications using server-side or client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an ""application-like"" experience within a Web browser. Application software developers also must consider a long array of screen sizes, hardware specifications, and configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and changes within each of the platforms. Mobile app development has been steadily growing, in revenues and jobs created.",https://www.invensis.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/5-Strategies-for-Mobile-App-Development-Success-Invensis.jpg
Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI, also machine intelligence, MI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence (NI) displayed by humans and other animals. In computer science AI research is defined as the study of ""intelligent agents"": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term ""artificial intelligence"" is applied when a machine mimics ""cognitive"" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as ""learning"" and ""problem solving"".",https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/1106723/ai_artificial_computer_deep_learning_intelligence_machine_learning_icon
Data Structures and Algorithms,"A data structure is an arrangement of data in a computer's memory or even disk storage. An example of several common data structures are arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, binary trees, and hash tables. Algorithms, on the other hand, are used to manipulate the data contained in these data structures as in searching and sorting.",https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAipAAAAJDAxZmQ4Mzk4LTYyMDEtNDAwNi1hYTUzLTI1Y2QxNWExMmY4OQ.png
Databases,"A database is not generally portable across different DBMSs, but different DBMSs can interoperate by using standards such as SQL and ODBC or JDBC to allow a single application to work with more than one DBMS. Computer scientists may classify database-management systems according to the database models that they support; the most popular database systems since the 1980s have all supported the relational model - generally associated with the SQL language",
