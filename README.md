## Overview

This is the backend repository for Project Lumos, a site that aims to be a central repository for open source knowledge resources. The backend is on Django REST Framework.

## Prerequisites
If you haven't already, install and configure PostgreSQL on your local machine[(guide)](http://www.marinamele.com/taskbuster-django-tutorial/install-and-configure-posgresql-for-django "guide")

create a database table named 'default_db', username being 'username' and password bieng 'password' to use for development.

## Setup
Create a virtual environment in which to install Python pip packages. Use python3

Install development dependencies,

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

---

Create database

`createdb pl_dev`


Setup database tables,

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

Run the web application locally,

`python manage.py runserver --settings=backend.settings.development` # 127.0.0.1:8000(localhost)


you can also set the environment variable in the virtual environment, to avoid writing the settings part everytime

`export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=backend.settings.development`

## Workflow


### APPs

### courses

This app consists of 6 class models namely Language, Domain, RowInformation, KnowledgeBase, Video and ExternalLink

1. Language class

5. KnowledgeBase class

  + This class is used to maintain attributes which are common to both the Video class and ExternalLink class. It inherits from RowInformation class. The attributes are title, description, slug, skill_level (to indicate the skill level required by the user to understand the resource), languages (list of languages associated with the resource object), domains (list of domains associated with the resource object), data_type (indicating type of resource, like video or tutorial), paid (indicates whether resource is paid), project (whether resource is a project resource).

6. SoftSkillsData class

7. RandomData class

  + This class refers to all the random resources. It consists of attributes like title, description, slug, link_url, data_type and paid

---

It also consists of 6 admin models namely DomainModelAdmin, LanguageModelAdmin, SoftSkillsModelAdmin, KnowledgeBaseModelAdmin,
SoftSkillsDataModelAdmin, RandomDataModelAdmin

1. LanguageModelAdmin class

  + Handles the admin site for Language class

2. DomainModelAdmin class

  + Handles the admin site for Domain class

3. SoftSkillsModelAdmin class

  + Handles the admin panel for SoftSkills class

4. KnowledgeBaseModelAdmin class

  + Handles the admin site for KnowledgeBaseModelAdmin class

5. SoftSkillsDataModelAdmin class

  + Handles the admin site for SoftSkillsDataModelAdmin class

6. RandomDataModelAdmin class

  + Handles the admin site for RandomDataModelAdmin class

  The admin models attributes are list_display (attributes to be displayed in the objects list), list_display_links (attributes that will link to detailed view of an object), list_filter (attributes to filter by in the objects list), search_fields (attributes which can be searched on the objects list), autocomplete_fields (get associated attributes from other models), readonly_fields (attributes which are read only in admin site)

  The view functions are

  ```
  def wikiscript(request, term):
    """
    This is a function that takes in request and a term from url
    which is a slug and runs wikipedia functions to return JSON data
    """
    term = str(term)
    wiki_dict = get_wiki_product_data(term)  #passing the term from url to get_wiki_product_data
    wiki_dict = json.dumps(wiki_dict)  #converting dictionary into JSON
    return JsonResponse(json.loads(wiki_dict))
  ```

  ```
  def dictscript(request, term):
